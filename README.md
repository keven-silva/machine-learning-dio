## Tranfer learning
- Load pre-train weights 
- Configure a new model
- Retrain the model with a new dataset
- Model accuracy and validation
- Visualize the data
    
<p>In this file, the subject of transfer of learning was addressed, through training weights.</p>

## Cats and dogs
- Cats and dogs dataset
- Configure a new model
- Retrain the model with a new dataset
- Model accuracy and validation
- Visualize the data

<p>In this file, two new classes "cats" and "dogs" were trained, using a classification model</p>

## Calculate and evaluate the scatter table metrics
- True positive
- False positive
- True negative
- False negative
- Sensitivity 
- Specificity 
- Accuracy 
- precision
- F-score 
- Roc curve

<p>In this file, methods were used to extract information from a dispersion table and some calculations were performed.</p>

## Yolo detection network
- Retrained two classes
- Yolov4 network

<p>In this file, two classes were retrained with the yolov4 network</p>

## Face recognition algorithm
- Configure a new model
- Retrain the model with a new dataset
- Model accuracy and validation
- Visualize the data
- Facial recognition

<p>In this file, yolov4 detection network was used, for face detection, the algorithm works with an image taken from the web cam or in real time.</p>

## virtual assistant
- Convert human speech to text
- Convert text to human speech
- Detect language
- Search online wikipedia
- Search online youtube

<p>In this file, we intended to create a virtual assistant that recognizes human speech and performs online searches.</p>
